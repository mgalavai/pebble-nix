# Pebble Nix: Product Requirements Document

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** Current Date  
**Status:** Draft  

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for Pebble Nix, a cloud-based development environment for Pebble smartwatch applications that enables developers to build Pebble apps without local SDK installation.

### 1.2 Product Overview
Pebble Nix provides a reproducible, Nix-based build system that packages the Pebble SDK 4.6-rc2 in a deterministic environment, resolving the numerous compatibility issues with Python 2.7 dependencies, and enabling both cloud-based and local development workflows.

### 1.3 Background
Since Pebble's acquisition by Fitbit and subsequent shutdown, continuing development for the platform has become increasingly difficult due to:
- The aging SDK's dependency on Python 2.7 (now EOL)
- Compatibility issues with modern operating systems
- Difficulty in establishing consistent build environments
- Network-dependent installation processes that frequently break

## 2. Product Vision

### 2.1 Vision Statement
To resurrect and sustain Pebble app development by providing a zero-configuration, cloud-ready development environment that works consistently across platforms and time.

### 2.2 Strategic Goals
1. Eliminate the need for local SDK installation
2. Create a fully reproducible build system using Nix
3. Enable seamless development through both cloud and local workflows
4. Ensure long-term compatibility despite the aging SDK requirements
5. Lower the barrier to entry for new Pebble developers

## 3. Target Users

### 3.1 User Profiles
1. **Existing Pebble Developers**
   - Experienced with the platform but frustrated by setup challenges
   - Need a reliable, low-maintenance build solution

2. **New Pebble Enthusiasts**
   - Acquired Pebble watches through secondary markets
   - Want to create or modify apps without complex setup

3. **Open Source Contributors**
   - Looking to maintain or enhance existing Pebble apps
   - Need a reproducible environment to ensure consistent builds

4. **Organizations Supporting Legacy Devices**
   - Companies or groups maintaining Pebble-compatible services
   - Need reliable build infrastructure for internal tools

### 3.2 User Pain Points
1. Complex, error-prone SDK installation process
2. Python 2.7 compatibility issues with modern systems
3. Network-dependent setup procedures that frequently break
4. Inconsistent builds across different development environments
5. Difficulty integrating with modern CI/CD pipelines

## 5. User Stories

### 5.1 New Developer
"As a new Pebble developer, I want to create a simple watchface without having to spend hours configuring my development environment, so I can focus on learning Pebble app development."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Clone repository template and make minor code changes
- Push to GitHub and receive a built .pbw file
- Install on Pebble watch and see changes
- Complete entire process in under 10 minutes

### 5.2 Existing Developer Migrating Projects
"As an existing Pebble developer, I want to move my projects to a reliable build system so I don't have to maintain complex local setups across my devices."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Convert existing project to Pebble Nix without code changes
- Build project successfully with equivalent output
- Maintain all current functionality
- Document conversion process for future projects

### 5.3 Open Source Maintainer
"As a maintainer of multiple Pebble apps, I want a consistent build system that works across contributor environments to ensure reliable releases."
